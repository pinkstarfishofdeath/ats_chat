Community project for a new chat at abovetopsecret.com

This code is in pre-alpha. Any use of it in it's current state is at 
your discretion.

Outline from TheAboveNetwork:

1. No database, use JSON and a RESTful protocol in a JavaScript/HTML5 
client

2. The results are free and open source.

3. It accept usernames & rights in a secure way, so that it can be 
integrated with any community. 

As of now the current code is very generic, forked and modified from
http://www.techumber.com/2012/11/Simple-Chat-Engine-Using-HTML5-Server-Sent-Events-And-PHP.html as a starting point for future code.
