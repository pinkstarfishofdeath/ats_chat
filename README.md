ats_chat
========

Community project for a new chat at abovetopsecret.com

This code is in pre-alpha. Any use of it in it's current state is at 
your discretion.

Outline from TheAboveNetwork:

1) The chat client be a JavaScript/HTML5 web application optimized for desktop and mobile

2) Actual chat data are JASON objects, using REST between server and client

3) An XML or JSON configuration file provides all settings and customizations (like multiple rooms, etc.)

4) The client uses modern CSS3 and HTML5 markup for easy customization/responsive design

5) A secure "handshake" provides authenticated user information to the chat client

6) User roles include member and moderator

7) An additional XML or JSON file tracks banned/kicked chat users

8) No database requirements

9) User authentication happens at the site-level (ATS) and is easily modified for other discussion boards, blogs, communities, etc.

10) Censored word list as an XML or JSON file

11) Allow embedding of videos, links, tweets, etc. 

As of now the current code is very generic, forked and modified from
http://www.techumber.com/2012/11/Simple-Chat-Engine-Using-HTML5-Server-Sent-Events-And-PHP.html as a starting point for future code.
